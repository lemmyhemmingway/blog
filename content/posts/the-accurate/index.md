One day I looked down and noticed my wrist was naked.  
Not metaphorically. Literally. No watch.  
Time was slipping by, and I didn’t even know who was doing the slipping.  
So I told myself:  
**“Oh you, poor soul unaware of time, it’s time… to get a timekeeper.”**

And I did.  
But not just any old tick-tock machine.  
I bought a **Mr. Jones**.

A watch brand that pretends to be British, was born in New York, raised in London, studied in Tokyo, and found spiritual enlightenment somewhere in Amsterdam.

The model?  
**_The Accurate._**  
Sounds trustworthy, doesn’t it?

But then you look at the dial, and it stares you dead in the eye with this gem:

> “**Remember, you will die.**”

**Excuse me??**  
I just wanted to know if it was time for coffee, and now I’m confronting mortality before breakfast?

---

It doesn’t tick.  
It doesn’t tock.  
It just… exists.  
Like a silent existential roommate.

You want to ask it:  
> _“Hey buddy, are you even working or just reflecting on the absurdity of existence?”_

---

Does it tell time?  
Yes.  
But it also tells *truths*.  
And sometimes that’s way too much honesty before 9 a.m.

It’s so accurate, you start measuring your remaining lifetime in nanoseconds.  
You stare at it and think:  
**“Well, there goes another minute… and another… and there goes my sense of denial.”**

---

Mr. Jones’s *Accurate* model doesn’t just tell time.  
It **whispers the spirit of time.**

> “Life’s short, go brew that coffee,” it suggests.  
> “You might make it to work, but don’t miss out on living,” it insists.

And every time you glance at your wrist,  
it gives you a little nudge and says with loving indifference:

> **“Remember, you will die.”**

---

I adore this watch.  
Every time I look at it, I laugh, then feel a slight existential cramp.

> _“Time doesn’t go forward or backward… it just drifts around, lost in its own thoughts.”_
